This GitHub repository contains all the necessary code to replicate the results presented in our research paper titled "Distinguishable IQ Feature Representation for Domain-Adaptation Learning of WiFi Device Fingerprints." 
Our paper is currently undergoing revision for publication in the IEEE Transaction on Machine Learning in Communications and Networking.

All the work has been done in NetStar Lab.
